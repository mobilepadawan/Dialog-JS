# Dialog-JS
Another JavaScript library to get alert, confirm, and prompt dialogs, but customizable.

## Starting now
You can't find something useful in the JS code, yet. I am doing some tests to integrate the HTML `<dialog>` element in the dialogs to use for.

Be patient, please. And test the other JS Libraries available in my Github Repo.
