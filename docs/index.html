        <p>We are looking for to give you the same experience to use than the classic JavaScript dialogs did you.</p>
        <p>As you can see in the sample code, we keep the simplyness to every dialog both on configuration, execution, and parameters to pass it.</p>
        <p>We know the universe of JavaScript libraries has more options, also very complete ones, to do the same that <strong>Dialog-JS</strong> do, but with a couple of more space to consume. Our vision is to keep the best reduced files to not increase the usage of RAM memory in your webapps. To respect our vision we need to limitate the funcionality of this product.</p>
        <p>The future versions of this library will includes some icons to illustrate optionally the Dialog windows for transmiting a better user experience. <strong>Keep an eye in our evolution!</strong></p>
